<p>The AREA element should be treated as a block level element, and must be directly inside the MAP element, not inside any of the other block level content inside it. If you intend to use normal block level content inside the map, I recommend you only put it where it makes sense, since it will be rendered, and also only put it inside an element where that sort of content is allowed (such as inside a DIV or LI element). Personally, I think the idea that a map should be inline is wrong, considering the way it is used, but that is what the spec says.</p>
<p>Areas are not rendered visually if image maps are supported. They remain invisible, and only create an area of the map that can be clicked. Browsers that cannot display image maps generally display a list of all the links and areas inside the map. To allow them to display the areas, each AREA needs the ALT attribute set, giving the text that should be displayed as the link content in these browsers. They will usually be displayed in the order that they are defined in the source, so make sure that it makes sense.</p>
